### Library Management System
A Java-based Library Management System developed as part of learning and applying core Java concepts. This project demonstrates the practical application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and various Java features to create a functional library management application.

### Project Overview
The Library Management System is a console-based application that enables users to manage a library's book inventory efficiently. It supports various functionalities like adding new books, searching for books by name or ISBN, issuing books, returning books, and sorting the book inventory based on different parameters. This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of fundamental Java programming skills.

### Key Features
Add New Books: Easily add new books to the library with details like title, author, ISBN, price, number of pages, and publisher.
Search Books: Search for books by either their name or ISBN for quick access.
Issue & Return Books: Manage book availability by issuing and returning books.
Delete Books: Remove books from the inventory.
Sorting Options: Sort books by various attributes, including book name, price, and number of pages using Java's Comparator interface.
Display All Books: List all available books in the library.
Exception Handling: Robust handling of invalid inputs and operations to ensure smooth user interaction.
Persistent Storage: Save and load book data using file systems for data persistence (if implemented).

### Concepts Applied
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Implemented OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism using Java classes.
Collections Framework: Utilized ArrayList for dynamic storage of book records.
Comparators: Used Comparator for custom sorting of books based on different attributes.
Exception Handling: Managed errors gracefully using try-catch blocks to handle scenarios like invalid inputs and book not found.
File I/O (Optional Feature): Integrated file handling to save and load book data for persistence (if implemented).

### Technologies Used
Language: Java (JDK 8 or higher)
IDE: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any other Java-compatible IDE
Version Control: Git

The application will display a menu with options:
Add Book
Search Book
Print All Books
Delete Book
Issue Book
Return Book
Sort Books
Exit

### Future Enhancements
GUI Integration: Implement a graphical user interface for a more user-friendly experience.
Database Support: Integrate with a relational database like MySQL for better data management and scalability.
User Authentication: Add a user login system to manage different user roles (e.g., Librarian, Member).
Advanced Search: Implement advanced search filters (e.g., by author, publication year, genre).
Reporting: Generate reports for issued books, available books, etc.
